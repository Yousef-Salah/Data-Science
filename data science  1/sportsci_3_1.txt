%X Human judges often have difficulty in determining the subtle differences in 
trajectories and speed between competitors in gymnastics. We have devised an 
objective scoring system for the compulsory vault by using video digitizing, 
infrared timers, and a computer algorithm. We combined the objective score with 
a human judge's score for form errors. The objective score successfully 
increased the differentiation between performances in a trial of 25 gymnasts at 
a competition.

%X For an athlete at the top of the field, a performance enhancement makes a 
difference to the chance of winning when it is about half the athlete's typical 
between-event variation in performance.  Measuring enhancements of this 
magnitude with adequate precision requires much bigger sample sizes than 
researchers normally use.  To avoid confusion over interpretation of their 
findings, researchers should therefore publish and explain the precision of 
their estimates of performance enhancement.

%X A new strength-training machine allows the user to instantly change 
resistance at any point in the exercise movement. The machine has the potential 
to improve strength by optimizing the time each targeted muscle spends under 
maximum stress. Whether it is more effective than other machines or free weights 
remains to be seen.

%X In a recent discussion on the Sportscience Forum contributors agreed that 
power cleans and power pulls are effective ways to develop power.  They also 
agreed that the stages involved in each lift need to be taught progressively, 
through a full range of motion; and with due regard to the training experience 
of the athlete.  Some trainers preferred the power pull or the other components 
of the power clean (hang clean and dead lift) on the grounds of sport 
specificity or ease of teaching.

%X Two examples demonstrate how research on aquatic animals can 
benefit research on human swimmers. In the first example, work 
by comparative biomechanists studying animals that move through 
the air-water interface has shown that for competitive swimmers 
the optimal depth during the glide phase is the depth that 
minimizes surface waves. The second example contributes to the 
ongoing argument on the nature of thrust generation in freestyle 
swimming. The dominant view is that lift generates more thrust 
than drag. These forces arise from steady-state fluid dynamics, 
but the movement of the thrust-generating surfaces creates 
unsteady fluid motion. Recent work on aquatic animal locomotion 
has shown that unsteady mechanisms probably play an important 
role in generating thrust, so the thrust-generating mechanisms 
used by competitive swimmers should be reevaluated.

%X The effects of nutritional strategies on performance in team games are 
uncertain, because changes in performance are hard to measure accurately in 
these sports.  A small number of researchers have used lab tests, simulated 
games, or real games to measure the effect of hydration status and carbohydrate 
feeding on simulated game performance.  The lack of consistency in the outcomes 
of these studies may be due to lack of precision in the measurement of 
performance, differences between athletes or sports in the effects of the 
nutritional intervention, or differences in environmental conditions between 
studies.  Until there are better research tools, those who work with team-sport 
athletes should continue to give nutritional advice based on research with 
endurance athletes.  However, the fluid and energy requirements in a team game 
may differ considerably from those of an endurance event, so the advice should 
be tempered by common sense and experience.

%X BACKGROUND. Protein and amino acids are among the most common nutritional 
supplements taken by athletes.  This review evaluates the theoretical rationale 
and potential effects on athletic performance of protein, purported anabolic 
amino acids, branched-chain amino acids, glutamine, creatine, and 
hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB). LITERATURE. Two books, 61 research articles, 10 
published abstracts, and 19 review articles or book chapters.  FINDINGS.  
Dietary supplementation of protein beyond that necessary to maintain nitrogen 
balance does not provide additional benefits for athletes.  Ingesting 
carbohydrate with protein prior to or following exercise may reduce catabolism, 
promote glycogen resynthesis, or promote a more anabolic hormonal environment.  
Whether employing these strategies during training enhances performance is not 
yet clear. There is some evidence from clinical studies that certain amino acids 
(e.g., arginine, histidine, lysine, methionine, ornithine, and phenylalanine) 
have anabolic effects by stimulating the release of growth hormone, insulin, 
and/or glucocorticoids, but there is little evidence that supplementation of 
these amino acids enhances athletic performance.  Branched-chain amino acids 
(leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and glutamine may be involved in exercise-
induced central fatigue and immune suppression, but their ergogenic value as 
supplements is equivocal at present.  Most studies indicate that creatine 
supplementation may be an effective and safe way to enhance performance of 
intermittent high-intensity exercise and to enhance adaptations to training. 
Supplementation with hydroxymethylbutyrate appears to reduce catabolism and 
increase gains in strength and fat-free mass in untrained individuals initiating 
training; as yet, limited data are available to decide how it affects training 
adaptations in athletes. CONCLUSIONS. Of the nutrients reviewed, creatine 
appears to have the greatest ergogenic potential for athletes involved in 
intense training.  FURTHER RESEARCH. All supplements reviewed here need more 
evaluation for safety and effects on athletic performance.
